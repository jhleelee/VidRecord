                    For my app in particular I needed to record speech WITHOUT all the distracting background fuzz. Using VOICE_RECOGNITION will pass the audio data into the phone's noise cancellation filters before handing it over to you.

So unless you're comfortable with implementing your own noise cancelling algorithm, it's much easier to just let the phone's built-in hardware handle it.

Another way to reduce noise is by using the AudioEffect NoiseSuppressor class available with Jelly Bean (Android 4.1 API level 16). I haven't looked into this very much as I still need to support Android 2.3.

The last method of noise cancellation is to use AudioManager.setParameters() which is available in API level 5+.

1.
am = (AudioManager) activity.getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);
2.
am.setParameters("noise_suppression=auto");
I'm uncertain about effective this is as there's little to no feedback on it's success status or whether manufacturers have even implemented it at all.
